# ML-Optimised Pairs Trading

## Project Overview

This project aimed to improve the returns of pairs trading strategies by leveraging machine learning and advanced optimization techniques.

## Background

Traditional pairs trading relies on statistical methods for pair selection and spread prediction, which can be limited in capturing complex patterns. Enhancing these methods with machine learning offers the potential for higher accuracy and returns.

## Key Contributions

- Developed a machine learning-based pairs trading strategy integrating Bayesian optimization for pair selection and XGBoost for next-day price spread forecasting.
- Implemented Bayesian Optimization to identify cointegrated stock pairs in Python.
- Utilized XGBoost to predict price spreads, allowing for dynamic trading decisions.

## Results

- Achieved a 19.81% return and a Sharpe ratio of 2.53.
- Outperformed benchmark strategies, including buy-and-hold and traditional pairs trading.
